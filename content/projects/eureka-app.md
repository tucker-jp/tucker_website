Eureka is an iOS journaling app that captures thoughts through voice, transcribes them in real-time, and uses AI to automatically categorize and surface insights from your journal entries.

The core idea is to make journaling effortless—just speak your thoughts whenever inspiration strikes, and let the app handle transcription, organization, and pattern recognition.

Currently in active development with a working prototype in personal use. The app successfully handles live audio transcription and basic AI categorization, with ongoing refinement of the categorization algorithms and UI polish.
