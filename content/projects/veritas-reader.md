Veritas Reader is a web-based reading platform that combines a curated library of open-source books with powerful AI capabilities for deeper understanding and exploration.

The platform features a custom EPUB and PDF reader with AI integration that allows readers to ask questions about specific pages, chapters, or entire books. The AI agent uses a customizable context window to provide relevant answers based on the selected scope.

Key features include AI-powered search across the entire library, intelligent bookmarking and note-taking, and the ability to compare passages across different works. The reader supports highlights, annotations, and cross-references with AI assistance.

Currently in active development with a working version in personal use. The core reading experience and AI question-answering system are functional, with ongoing work on expanding the book library and refining the search algorithms.
