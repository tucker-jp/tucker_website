description: On the economy of attention and what we choose to spend it on.

We talk about "paying attention" as if it's a transaction. And in many ways, it is—perhaps the most consequential one we make every day.

## The Asymmetry of Exchange

Unlike money, attention isn't fungible. An hour spent reading a book isn't the same as an hour scrolling social media, even though both consume the same amount of time. The quality of attention matters as much as the quantity.

The platforms we use understand this better than we do. They've built entire business models around capturing "engaged time"—not just any attention, but the kind that keeps us coming back, that makes us click, that generates data.

## What We're Actually Trading

When we give our attention freely, we're trading something finite and non-renewable. We can earn more money, but we can't earn back time. We can't restock our attention reserves once they're depleted.

This makes attention more valuable than currency in the traditional sense. And yet we're remarkably careless with how we spend it.

## The Architecture of Distraction

Modern digital spaces are designed to fragment attention. Notifications, autoplay videos, infinite scroll—these aren't accidents of design. They're intentional features meant to keep attention flowing in one direction: toward the platform.

The result is a kind of cognitive fragmentation. We become less capable of sustained focus, less able to engage deeply with complex ideas. Our attention becomes optimized for rapid switching rather than sustained engagement.

## Reclaiming Agency

What would it look like to treat attention as scarce and valuable?

**Setting boundaries.** Choosing when and where to be reachable. Creating spaces—both physical and temporal—where attention can be undivided.

**Designing for depth.** Seeking out media and environments that reward sustained engagement rather than rapid consumption. Books instead of tweets. Conversations instead of comments.

**Auditing consumption.** Regularly asking: *What did I pay attention to today? Was it worth the cost?*

## The Quiet Rebellion

There's something quietly radical about guarding your attention in a world that constantly demands it. About choosing depth over breadth, focus over fragmentation.

It's not about disconnecting entirely—that's neither realistic nor desirable. It's about being intentional with one of the most valuable resources we have.

Because what we pay attention to shapes who we become. And that's not a transaction we should make lightly.
