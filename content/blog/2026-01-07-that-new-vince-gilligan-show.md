Pluribus is set in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the same setting as Gilligan’s first two hits, *Breaking Bad* and *Better Call Saul*. It’s a little funny, given that he’s from Richmond, Virginia. Maybe it’s those desert skies.

My first impression of *Pluribus* is that America’s TV hype machine may have oversold it. That isn’t about the plot. The plot is interesting. In fact, the premise is one of the most intriguing I’ve seen in a while, and it leaves plenty of room to grow.

The problem, for me, is the performance. Rhea Seehorn overacts in a show that badly needs restraint, someone with the grounding presence of her former co-star, or even Seehorn herself as she was in *Better Call Saul*. Here, she feels like she’s playing to an invisible back row.

Once you sit with it for a minute, the Straussian reading is hard to miss. The main character, one of only eleven sentient people left on Earth, is forced into a philosophical reckoning. What does life look like when material abundance comes at no cost, and when a sycophantic superintelligence, unexplained by either science or itself, will do and answer whatever you want? It even gets its feelings hurt, too. Sorry, ChatGPT, this one is a bit on the nose.

As with most TV, I’m quick to quit. I’ll let others burn their daylight on its seven or so seasons. If the hype fades, I’ll never think about it again. If the hype holds, I might drift back, the way I eventually did with *Better Call Saul*.
