I'm not making New Year's resolutions this year. Not because I think they're useless—some people thrive on them—but because I've found they don't work for me.

Instead, I'm doubling down on the handful of things that already matter: reading more than I scroll, building things that solve real problems, and spending time with people whose company I genuinely enjoy.

The goal isn't transformation. It's consistency with what already works.
