There's something vulnerable about publishing work that isn't polished yet. But I'm increasingly convinced it's the right approach.

## The Fear of Imperfection

For years, I hesitated to share projects publicly. What if the code wasn't clean enough? What if someone found a bug? What if the design wasn't quite right?

This perfectionism was protective, but it was also limiting. Ideas stayed locked in private repos. Writing stayed in draft folders. Nothing shipped.

## Permission to Experiment

Building in public means giving yourself permission to experiment. It means showing the messy middle, not just the finished product.

Some benefits I've noticed:

- **Faster iteration** — feedback comes early when it's most useful
- **Less attachment** — easier to kill ideas that aren't working
- **Real accountability** — saying you'll do something publicly makes it more likely to happen

## What This Looks Like

For me, building in public doesn't mean streaming every thought or sharing every commit. It means:

- Publishing writing that's "good enough" rather than waiting for perfect
- Sharing projects when they're functional, not flawless
- Being honest about what's working and what isn't

This site is part of that practice. It's live, it's evolving, and it's imperfect. And that's exactly the point.
