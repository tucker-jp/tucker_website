description: A fresh start with a new personal website. Here's what I'm building and why.
---

After years of thinking about it, I've finally built a proper personal website. This is the place where I'll share writing, projects, and the occasional photo.

## Why Now?

I wanted a space that felt like *mine*—not an algorithm-driven feed, not someone else's platform. Just a quiet corner of the internet where I can publish longer thoughts without character limits or engagement metrics.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Ideas** that don't fit neatly into social media posts
- **Projects** I'm working on, from code to creative experiments
- **Observations** about technology, design, and the world around us

This won't be a daily blog. I'm aiming for quality over frequency—something worth reading when it shows up.

## The Stack

For the technically curious: this site is intentionally simple. Static HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and Markdown files managed through Decap CMS. No build pipeline, no framework overhead. Just the essentials.

Thanks for stopping by. More to come soon.
