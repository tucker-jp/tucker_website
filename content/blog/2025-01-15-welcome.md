After years of thinking about it, I've finally built a proper personal website. This is the place where I'll share writing, projects, and the occasional photo.

## What This is For:

Keeping records of my personal work, reading, and interests.

## The Stack:

For the technically curious: this site is intentionally simple. Static HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and Markdown files managed through Decap CMS. No build pipeline, no framework overhead. Just the essentials.

Thanks for stopping by. More to come soon.
