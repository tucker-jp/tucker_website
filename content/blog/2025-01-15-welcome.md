After thinking about it for a long time, I finally put together a proper personal website. This is where I’ll share writing, projects, and the occasional photo.

**What this is for:**

Keeping a record of my work, interests, and things I’m thinking through over time.

**How it’s built:**

For the technically curious, the site is intentionally simple—static HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and Markdown managed with Decap CMS. There’s a small build step for indexing and optimization, but no frameworks or heavy tooling. Just the essentials.

Thanks for stopping by. More to come.
