For those who would like to have an intellectual influence in the post-GPT world, I would highly recommend writing in public. This can be under a pseudonym, using a personal website, or through the various channels that technology has created, such as X or Threads.

With larger context windows, writers will benefit immensely because the AI will understand them in a deeper sense due to the greater number of tokens available as input. This may sound hand-wavey, but consider how much information users already provide using their LLM chatbots—health records, family history, career information, interests and hobbies, marital problems, etc. Over time, it is likely that individuals will have AI agents that know their interests, goals, and background well enough to execute tasks independently on their behalf.

Say the year is 2055 and you have the opportunity to provide an entire history of your life to an AI memoir business. The benefit of having a written corpus of thought beginning in the pre-AI era would be to reduce hallucinations in the memoir and help build a family history. I personally believe there is a high likelihood of such a product existing in the coming decade.

Consider the additional value provided by being able to question an LLM version of yourself trained on your writings from your 20-year-old self. The energy and personality of such a chatbot could provide insight into how you have changed, along with other observations.
