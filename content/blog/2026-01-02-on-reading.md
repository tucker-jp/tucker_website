I used to feel guilty about abandoning books halfway through. Not anymore.

The shift happened when I realized that reading, like most valuable activities, benefits from a certain ruthlessness. If a book isn't delivering value—whether that's insight, pleasure, or useful information—there's no virtue in grinding through it.

**The antilibrary concept**

Nassim Taleb writes about the "antilibrary"—the collection of unread books that reminds you of what you don't know. I'd extend this: your reading list should also include books you've started and abandoned. They're markers of paths explored and rejected, which is just as valuable as paths followed to completion.

**Trial and error**

The trick is being bored with a specific book rather than with reading itself. Move quickly between books. Sample widely. When something clicks, dig deep. When it doesn't, move on without ceremony.

This approach has led me to read far more, and far more diversely, than when I forced myself through every book I picked up.
