Twitter’s been flooded with Claude Code, especially the CLI. I use it too. It’s genuinely strong and about as close as  you can get to having a software engineer on retainer who will try whatever you ask immediately.

What’s more interesting is everything outside coding. You can let Claude roam a directory, take notes, and gradually build personal context. People are already testing this on DNA data, law school essays, emails, and more.

In that light, the Obsidian founders’ [stubborn bet on markdown-first integration](https://x.com/kepano/status/1675626836821409792?s=20), even at the expense of app polish, looks prescient.
