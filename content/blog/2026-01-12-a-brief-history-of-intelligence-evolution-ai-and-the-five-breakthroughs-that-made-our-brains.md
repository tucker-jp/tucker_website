I started reading this yesterday. Exceptional and interesting thus far. The author is a former ML engineer, so his understanding of biology, albeit stronger than mine, is mostly secondhand.

It is especially interesting that he wrote this directly after the release of GPT-4. In a way, this book serves as a time capsule of what people at the front of their field actually thought about LLMs three years ago.

I would recommend.
