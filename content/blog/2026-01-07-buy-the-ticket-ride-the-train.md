I am running the substantial, and unforgiveable, risk of sounding like a motivational self-help influencer so please bare with me.


I recently listened to an interview recently that reiterated some of my favorite advice: if you want to go somewhere then just have to buy the damn ticket. 

Put aside the crude nature of this [Yogi Berra ](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/79014.Yogi_Berra) aphorism. The truth ingrained is tremendous if leveraged.

It reminded me of watching YouTube videos when I first committed myself to running a marathon.

Do this, eat that, run at this time. What ended up working more than anything else was just running. From running I learned that I get hurt by running at a fast pace 6 miles everyday and yet I never get hurt by running 3 miles slowly with a long, fast 13 mile run twice a week which is approx. the same total mileage.

Coding, languages, photography, and every other skill are essentially the same in this way. Most people walk around with a camera that has a 1/2.6" sensor in their pocket and a supercomputer that automatically refines every manual aspect of photography. So why is everyone so bad at taking photos (myself notwithstanding).

Its because we never take off the training wheels. Buy a real camera or start editing the raw photos on your phone. Your ugly photographs will drive you to learn within a week how important sensor size, aperture, timing, shutter speed, and ISO are to photography.

My favorite example is walking up to a café in Lyon, FR and ordering an espresso. I forgot my *s'il vous plaît* at the door and the French gentleman working the counter taught me my fastest French lesson ever: if you forgetfully neglect greeting or requesting something politely in France you are flipping the bird.
