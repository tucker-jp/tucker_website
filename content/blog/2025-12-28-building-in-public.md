I've started sharing projects earlier in their development cycle. Not because they're ready for public consumption, but precisely because they're not.

**The fear of shipping incomplete work**

There's a natural tendency to wait until something is "polished" before showing it to anyone. The problem is that polish takes time, and time spent polishing the wrong thing is wasted.

By sharing early—even if it's just screenshots, rough prototypes, or half-formed ideas—I get feedback when it's still cheap to change direction.

**What I'm building**

Right now I'm working on two main projects:

- **Eureka App**: A voice journaling app for iOS that transcribes in real-time and uses AI to surface patterns in your entries
- **Veritas Reader**: A curated library of open-source books with AI-powered search and contextual Q&A

Both are still rough around the edges. Both are already useful to me. And both will get better faster because I'm not waiting for perfection before sharing them.

**The upside**

Building in public creates accountability. It's harder to abandon a project when people have seen it and asked about it. And occasionally, someone reaches out with exactly the insight or connection you needed.

So here's to shipping messy, iterating publicly, and seeing where it leads.
