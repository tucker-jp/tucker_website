I've been thinking about speed lately. Not hustle culture or burnout-inducing sprints, but the compounding advantages of moving quickly on the right things.

When you ship something in a week instead of a month, you get three extra weeks of feedback, iteration, and learning. Do this consistently over a year and the gap between you and someone moving slower becomes enormous.

This applies to everything: writing, coding, starting conversations, making decisions.

The key is distinguishing between speed and rushing. Speed is about removing friction and saying no to things that don't matter. Rushing is about doing things poorly because you're optimizing for the wrong metric.

Move fast. Don't rush.
